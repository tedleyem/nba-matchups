I use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the **NBA Matchups Dashboard**. Here are some advice for users that want to report an issue:

1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of the **NBA Matchups Dashboard**. Check the Version number from your dashboard in the footer.
2. Please provide reproducible steps for the issue to help shorten the time it takes for it to be fixed.
3. Some issues may be browser-specific, so specifying in what browser you encountered the issue might help.
4. Sumbit through github Issues
